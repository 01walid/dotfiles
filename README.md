# dotfiles

Feel at `$HOME`, these are my personal config files (a.k.a dot files), I manage them using [a git bare repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). Not everything is included yet, working on it.

## what am I using? 
Arch Linux with: 

- Terminal: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).
- tmux with [oh my tmux!](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux).
- the fish shell, with [oh my fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish).
- vim ([neovim](https://neovim.io/)).
- [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/), the tiling window manager.

### TODO
- [ ] dmenu, polybar config.
- [ ] fonts.
- [ ] picom.
- [ ] zshrc.
- [ ] bootstrap script (with pacman/aur packages).
